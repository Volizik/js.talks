Hello everyone, and welcome to today's video lesson on how to format a phone number using JavaScript.
In this lesson, we will be learning how to take an array of ten numbers and convert it into a phone number format we define.

The first step is to define our function, which we will call "createPhoneNumber".
Our function will take an array of ten numbers as an argument.

Once the function is defined, we need to make sure that the input array contains exactly 10 numbers.
We can do this by checking the length of the array.
If the length is not equal to 10, we will throw an error that says "Array must have 10 numbers".

Next, we need to define our desired phone number format. We will define a string variable called "number" and set it equal to format like this.

Ok, when we have our desired format, we need to replace the placeholder characters "x" with the numbers from our input array.
To do this, we will use the forEach method to loop through each number in the array and replace the corresponding "x" in our "number" variable.

Finally, we will return the resulting string as the output of our function.

And that's it! Now you know how to format a phone number in JavaScript using an array of ten numbers.
I hope you enjoyed this video lesson and learned something new.
